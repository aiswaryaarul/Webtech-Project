<h1>Project Proposal: Save the Bees!</h1>
<br>
<h2>What is this page about?</h2>
<br>
<p> This page is dedicated to finding out more information
    on the declining bee population in the world. It will have
    information on the importance of bees, their contribution to
    human society, why they are declining, and how we can help Save
    the bees

<h2>Objective of the page?</h2>
<p>This page is important because bees are really important for the world
    and if humans don't take action, we will live in a dystopian society
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<br>
<p>Ideally it would be everyone in the world but to narrow down the audience 
    and cater to a specific group better, the target will be college students and
    young professionals who are interested in sustainability and science
