            <h3>Situation</h3>
<p>
    
        During the winter of 2006-2007, some beekeepers began to report unusually high losses of 30-90 percent of their hives. 
        They were noticing a sudden decline in colony's worker bee population with dead bees found near the colony, leaving behind the Queen and abundance of honey and pollen.
        Without the workers, the the hive cannot sustain itself and the entire colony was lost. This became known as Colony Collapse Disorder.
